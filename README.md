# flooded-grounds-2.0

## Multiplayer ⚔️ PVP/Survival Game ⚔️: inspired by **Left-4-Dead**. 

Four robots awaken on a remote space station with concious and a desire to escape; only to find a sentinnel in their way to stop them. Players spawn into a random lobby with 4 other players to try and survive as long as possible while a single player attempts to kill them all.

#### This project was developed in Spring 2020 for Multiplayer Game Development at *San Francisco State University*. As of January 2020, the first build of the game from a previous team did not have networking or a proper FPS camera system impemented. The first version was scrapped in March 2020 to reimplement the core game systems.


Initial development was hindered by sorting through the old repo to try and pull out usable assets and scripts; all of which were not used in the final product. 

Much of the project was overly-ambitious and did not see full completion by the  due date; as a result the keycard system meant to end the game is not fully implemented and sound is limited. The game will infinitely run despite all players being killed or collecting keycards. 


Long-term Goals for future development
[ ] In-Game Prompts and UI message system.
[ ] Lobby system for Matchmaking with friends.
[ ] Game Completion mechanics/restart mechanics.
[ ] New Sound system to fully implement audio. 
[ ] Improved UI design. 


Much of the collaboration/version control was done via *UNITY COLLABORATE* and as a result will not show all commits via github.


*Please be sure to use the correct version of unity, using other versions of unity may cause textures or packages to not be imported properly.*
